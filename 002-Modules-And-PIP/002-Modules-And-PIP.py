# Modules are used to borrow the code of other programmers (you can use someone else's code in your python program)

## Two types of modules:
# - Built in modules (shipped with python by default)(see pythons website to see all)
# - External modules which are installed using 'pip' (code written by others)

# pip install <Module-Name>

# write 'python' or 'python3' to run python in your CLI

# import pandas # Will generate error if 'pandas' is not installed. (pandas is an external module)

import math # no errors (math is a built in module)
