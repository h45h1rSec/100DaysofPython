# 100DaysofPython

Welcome to my #100DaysofPython journey! This repository documents my daily progress, projects, and learning experiences as I commit to coding in Python for at least an hour every day for 100 days. Join me in this challenge to enhance Python skills and build a solid foundation in programming.

## Motivation

- üöÄ Sharpen Python programming skills.
- üåê Explore diverse Python libraries and frameworks.
- üß† Gain hands-on experience in solving real-world problems with Python.

## Rules

- Code in Python for at least one hour every day.
- Share daily updates on progress and learning on social media using the hashtag #100DaysofPython.
- Encourage and engage with the coding community to foster a collaborative learning environment.
- Learning as a cybersec student, will also try to cover major security aspects and automations.

## Projects

Will upload soon

## Learning Resources

List any online courses, books, or tutorials used during the challenge.

Thank you for joining me on this exciting Python learning journey! Let's make each day count. Happy coding!

`print(HELLO WORLD, HELLO PYTHON")`

## Motive
- I am willing to continue even after the 100 Days, as I would like to explore Python in the basis of **Networking**, **Automating** and other aspects of Cyber Security.
